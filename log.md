# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 21, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Environment setup, installed libraries and dependencies, subscribed to courses

**Thoughts:** I am really excited as well as nervous to take up this challenge. But I know, I have the willpower to complete it

**Link to work:** [None]

### Day 1: July 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a Todo list. Done with 'add task' functionality

**Thoughts:** Since today being the first day, it took me a lot of time and errors to finally complete one functionality. Hopeful for the next days

### Day 2: July 23, 2020

### Day 3: July 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added the delete functionality, thus completing the simple ToDo application with basic CRUD operation

**Future scope:**

### Day 4: July 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Created a new branch on the master repo. Added the task status update functionality. 

**Description:** 
When a task is done and checkbox is clicked, a ajax call is fired which changes the status of the task and refreshes the page.
Scope of improvement: This ajax call is redundant, as the page is getting refreshed anyway, to display the changes. Would work on simplying the code and reduce the number of calls to server.

### Day 5: July 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Removed the ajax call for updating task status. Instead, made a form which autosubmits on checkbox click 

**Description:** 
When user clicks on the checkbox, form is autosubmitted and the status of the task is updated.

**Further scope**: Implement user authorization/authentication, unit testing
